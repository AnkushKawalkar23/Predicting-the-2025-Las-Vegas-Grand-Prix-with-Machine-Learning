# Predicting-the-2025-Las-Vegas-Grand-Prix-with-Machine-Learning
🏎️ Overview

This project builds a lightweight but effective Machine Learning model to predict the results of the 2025 Las Vegas Grand Prix using publicly available F1 data.

It uses FastF1, scikit-learn, and Python to train a model based on:

2024 Las Vegas sector times

2025 qualifying performance

Team performance scores

Driver race-pace baselines

Weather forecast

Position change tendencies

The goal:
Predict each driver’s race pace and generate a finishing order + podium forecast.
